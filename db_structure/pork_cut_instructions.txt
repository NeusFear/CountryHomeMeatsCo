//Note for all dropdowns is that they don't require you to select values in that dropdown, you can double click in the field and enter a cutsom value.
	
//The first dropdown (1 2) is how many of this cut are to be fresh or cured (we can do this differently)

//Ham because it's weird

//if selected endsForRoast suggest in the second dropdown centers .5" 2/pkg
//if selected shankForRoast suggest in the seccond dropdown buttEnd .5" 2/pkg
